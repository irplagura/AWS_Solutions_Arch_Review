## What is S3
* S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. 
* Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. 

## So what is S3
* S3 is a safe place to store your files. 
* It is Object-based storage. 
* The data is spread across multipl devices and facilities. 

## S3 - The Basics
* S3 is a safe place to store your files. 
* It is Object-based storage. 
* The data is spread across multipl devices and facilities. 
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally. 
* https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru 
* When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a 
* **HTTP 200** code if the upload was successful. 

## S3 - Objects
* S3 is Object based. Think of Objects just as files. 
* Objects consist of the following: 
* Key (This is simply the name of the object) 
  *  Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes). 
  * Version ID (Important for versioning) 
* Metadata (Data about data you are storing 
* Subresources; 
  * Access Control Lists 
  * Torrent 


## Data Consistency Model for S3
How does data consistency work for S3? 
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects 
* Eventual Consistency for overwrite: 
  * **PUTS** and **DELETES** (can take some time to propagate) 

In Other Words; 
* If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data. 
* If you update **AN EXISTING** file ordelete a file and read it immediately, you may get the olderr version, or you may not. 
* Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate. 


## S3 Guarantees
S3 has the following guarantees from Amazon; 
* Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform. 
* Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability 
* Amazon guarantees 99.999999 durability for S3 information. (Remember 11x9's) 


## S3 - Features
S3 has the following features; 
* Tiered Storage Available 
* Lifecycle Management 
* Versioning 
* Encryption 
* MFA Delete 
* Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies 


## S3 Storage Classes
1. **S3 Standard**  
* 99.99% availability 
* 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently. 

2. **S3-lA** (Infrequently Accessed)
* For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. 
* Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee. 

3. **S3 One Zone - IA** 
* For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience. 

4. **S3 - Intelligent Tiering** 
* Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. 

5. **S3 Glacier** 
* S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. 
* You can reliably store any amount of data at cos that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. 
* Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours. 

6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** 
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class 
* Retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

## S3 Charges
You are charged for S3 in the following ways; 
* Storage 
* Requests 
* Storage Management Prici 
* Data Transfer Pricing 
* Transfer Acceleration 
* Cross Region Replication Pricing 


## Cross Region Replication
Bucket on one region replicates a bucket on another region

## S3 Transfer Acceleration
* Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. 
* Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon **CloudFront**'s globally distributed **edge locations**. 
* As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

# Exam Tips
* Remember that S3 is Object-based: i.e. allows you to upload files. 
* Files can be from O Bytes to 5 T B. 
* There is unlimited storage. 
* Files are stored in Buckets. 
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally. 
* https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru 

* Not suitable to install an operating system on. 
* Successful uploads will generatea **HTTP 200** status code. 
* You can turn on MFA Delete 

* Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket 
Polices 

#### The Key Fundamentals of S3 Are; 
* Key (This is simply the name of the object) 
* Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes). 
* Version ID (Important for versionigg) 
* Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
  * Subresources 
  * Access Control Lists 
  * Torrent
